    "## Introduction to the Center of Light\n",
    "The Center of Light is a concept that results from the way Luminous Intensity is defined. \n",
    "The quantity of luminous intensity allows to express the emitted light with a directional dependency- integrating over any spacial distribution of the light source. This is a desired simplification of reality. The Luminous Intensity itself is a model with the assumption, that the luminous object is a point source. The Center of Light is the link between a real luminous object and this model: It is the point that the object is reduced to. The Center of Light is therefore a property of the luminous object, that has to be taken into account when measuring luminous intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard setup for measuring luminous intensity is a farfield goniometer. It uses a detector revolving around the object or vice versa at a constant distance. A luminous intensity distribution (LID) is constructed from multiple measurements performed for different directions relative to the center of the machine. For every measured direction it samples the illumincance caused by the source at this distance and derives from it the luminous intensity. This measurement setup assumes point source in the center of the machine.\n",
    "The Model is implicitly used, but the actual object position is up to the user. The Center of Light of the luminous object is generally unknown, this opens up the possibility to introduce an error from the placement of the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is an inherent error resulting from the size of the object. This has been explored under the topic of the limiting photometric distance. (link) This Error has the same underlying root as the error from translated Center of Light: Light coming from places other than the assumed point location. This results in deviating measurement distances and angles for different measurement directions. The unknown luminance characteristic of the object leads to a uncertainty contribution that cannot be prevented. Instead the measurement distance is increased to reduce uncertainty to a acceptable margin. \n",
    "There are good tools and rules of thumb in place to estimate this uncertainty. (link)\n",
    "In contrast, the Center of Light is not taken into account at all.\n",
    "Therefore the aim is to:\n",

    "## Modeling the error from LC\n",
    "Analytical Model of goniometer with translated point source.  The LID is generally calculated from the illuminance distribution in a certain distance from the photometric Center: A point light source with the distribution$I_s(\\theta,\\phi)$ placed in the center has a illuminance distribution according to the inverse-square-law:\n",
    "$$E(\\theta,\\phi) = {I_s(\\theta,\\phi) \\over {r_c}^2} \\cdot cos(\\alpha_d)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With $r_c$ being the measuring distance to the center and $\\alpha_d$ being the incidence angle of the light striking the detector. Both the source and the detector are modelled as points. This implies, that the distance between the source and detector is assumed to be sufficiently large so that the error from both point-assumptions is negligible. Since the distance between source and detector is known and the detector is oriented perpendicular to the source, the luminous intensity distribution can be calculated:\n",
    "$$I_m(\\theta,\\phi) = {E(\\theta,\\phi) \\cdot r_c^2} = I_s$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the measurement $I_m$ is consistent with the true LID $I_s$. If we now introduce a translation to the LC, the measured LI deviates from the LI of the source.\n",
    "- introduce coord system here, picture with all angles etc.\n",
    "- notation: every angles measured are marked according to the origin to which they are measured. $\\theta_c$ and $\\phi_c$ describe a direction originating from the photometric center and therefore correspond with the angles of the C-plane coordinate system. Similarly $\\theta_s$ and $\\phi_s$ describe angles relating to the light source.\n",
    "- Aim: calculate the error between the measured luminous intensity $I_m(\\theta_c, \\phi_c)$  and the corresponding luminous intensity of the source $I_s(\\theta_c, \\phi_c)$ resulting from a certain translation. The relation between $I_s$ and $I_m$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I_m(\\theta_c,\\phi_c,\\mathbf{s}) = \\underbrace{I_s(\\theta_s,\\phi_s)}_\\text{direction} \\cdot \\underbrace{r_c^2 \\over r_s^2}_\\text{distance} \\cdot \\underbrace{cos(\\alpha_d)}_\\text{incidence}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The influence of LC translation can be separated in three different components. With the goniometer moved to a certain direction measured with $\\theta_c,\\phi_c$ the LID of the object is actually sampled at diverging angles: $\\theta_s, \\phi_s$. This component is called the **Direction Error**. Additionally the distance between source and detector is now different for every direction introducing a **Distance Error**. Lastly the incidence angle of the light striking the detector changes, resulting in the **Angle of Incidence Error**.\n",
    "These three components will now be derived and explained in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Distance Error**\n",
    "Because luminous intensity is not measured directly but instead inferred from illuminance, it requires the knowledge of the distance between source and detector. With the source offset from the photometric center, this distance $r_s$ is different for every detector position. But when converting to luminous intensity the constant distance to the photometric center $r_c$ is used isntead, introducing an error. To describe this error both source and detector are expressed as points in the coordinate system of the goniometer.\n",
    "Position of the source: $\\mathbf{s} = (s_x,s_y,s_z)$\n",
    "Position of the detector for a particular measurement direction: $\\mathbf{d(\\theta_c,\\phi_c)} = (d_x,d_y,d_z)$\n",
    "The cartesian coordinates of the detector position are converted from the given C-plane (or polar)-coordinates as follows:\n",
    "$$d_x(\\theta_c,\\phi_c) = r_c \\cdot sin(\\theta_c) \\cdot cos(\\phi_c)$$\n",
    "$$d_y(\\theta_c,\\phi_c) = r_c \\cdot sin(\\theta_c) \\cdot sin(\\phi_c)$$\n",
    "$$d_z(\\theta_c,\\phi_c) = r_c \\cdot cos(\\theta_c)$$\n",
    "The distance between source and detector is then $r_s = \\vert\\vert \\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{sd}} \\vert\\vert = \\sqrt{\\dots}$ Applying the inverse-square-law as before yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I_1 = {{I_s \\over {r_s}^2} \\cdot r_c^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Direction Error**\n",
    "The angles $\\theta_s, \\phi_s$ describe the direction at which the detector is pointed at the source. To calculate these angles the detector positions realtive to the source position are required. These are the vectors $\\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{sd}}$ treated as points $\\mathbf{sd} = (sd_x, sd_y, sd_z)$. This basically corresponds to a coordinate transform from the photometric center to the position of the source. These cartesian coordinates are then converted back into C-plane (or polar)-coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_s(\\theta_c,\\phi_c,\\mathbf{s}) = cos^{-1}({sd_z \\over r_s})$$\n",
    "$$\\phi_s(\\theta_c,\\phi_c,\\mathbf{s}) = tan^{-1}({sd_y \\over sd_x})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the other two error components the direction error is not just defined by the geometry of the measurement but instead introduces a dependency on the LID of the source that is measured. In the simplest case, where the LID is isotropic, this error is nonexistent since the luminous intensity $I_s(\\theta_s,\\phi_s)$ is the same as $I_s(\\theta_c,\\phi_c)$. The extent of this error is defined by the difference in luminous intensity between the assumed and actual measurement direction. It therefore scales with the gradient of the LID of the object and will be larger for directions with a high gradient in luminous Intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Angle of Incidence Error**\n",
    "Lastly there is an error because a translation of the source changes the incidence angle. It is the angle $\\alpha_d$  between the vectors $\\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{cd}}$ from the photometric center to the detector and $\\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{sd}}$. It's defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$cos(\\alpha)={\\langle \\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{cd}},\\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{sd}} \\rangle \\over \\vert\\vert \\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{cd}} \\vert\\vert \\cdot \\vert\\vert \\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{sd}} \\vert\\vert}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " Since all parts of the error are invariant to scaling, this model can also be used with relative units. When applicable for the following investigations all distances are expressed relative to the measurement distance $r_c$. This allows for generalized insights, that are valid for all goniometer setups.\n"

Each of these measurements is individually afflicted with an uncertainty. The uncertainty is comprised of various contributions. They stem from the mechanical measurement setup, the sensor and are also effected by the object to be measured.\n",
    "It is an ongoing effort to better model the uncertainty of photogoniometric measurements. Currently most measurements lack an uncertainty evaluation entirely, which complicates a comparison of measurements.\n",
    "The uncertainty contribution of the sensor, either photometer or camera-based, can already be modelled. The same is true for the uncertainty contribution from the manipulator, that is positioning and orienting the source or detector. Since the location and orientation of the object placed on the goniometer is unknown, the uncertainty of the manipulator pose cannot be propagated to the source and its luminous intensity distribution and then further through the sensor system. This is a missing link in the uncertainty chain, that prevents a proper uncertainty evaluation. \n",
