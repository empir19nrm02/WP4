    "# Influence of a deviating center of light on the uncertainty of photogoniometric measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The luminous intensity distribution (LID) is constructed from multiple measurements performed for different directions relative to the source. These measurements are normally performed with a far field photogoniometer. For every measured direction it samples the illumincance caused by the source in a certain distance and derives from this the luminous intensity. \n",
    "Each of these measurements is individually afflicted with an uncertainty. The uncertainty is comprised of various contributions. They stem from the mechanical measurement setup and the sensor and are also effected by the object to be measured.\n",
    "It is an ongoing effort to better model the uncertainty of photogoniometric measurements. Currently most measurements lack an uncertainty evaluation entirely, which makes comparing the measurements impossible.\n",
    "The uncertainty contribution of the sensor, either photometer or camera-based, can already be modelled. So can the uncertainty contribution from the manipulator, that is positioning and orienting the source or detector. Since the location and orientation of the object placed on the goniometer is unknown, the uncertainty of the manipulator pose cannot be propagated to the source and its luminous intensity distribution and then further through the sensor system. This is a missing link in the uncertainty chain, that prevents a proper uncertainty evaluation. \n",
    "Trying to include the object's pose in the uncertainty evaluation raises multiple questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the correct pose of the object on the goniometer?\n",
    "\n",
    "The pose of the object in the coordinate system of the goniometer is separated into two components: rotation and translation. It is for the operator to decide how to place and orient the object in the coordinate system of the goniometer. The rotation is motivated by the use case. The object may be oriented with its optical axis aligned to a certain direction of the goniometer coordinates for example.\n",
    "The position or translation of the object is dictated by definition of luminous intensity:  the center of light of the object has to be placed in the origin of the goniometer. The center of light is generally unknown. This paper will explore the meaning and definition of the center of light. The aim is to enable some intuition about where the center of light of an object can be expected and consequently how it should be positioned.\n",
    "- What impact does a deviation in rotation / translation have on the LID?\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of a rotation has already been investigated. (Link) Placing the object into the goniometer with a rotational offset only rotates the LID, which can be corrected after the measurement.  A translated source brings about a deviation in the measured luminous intensity that is different for every direction. \n",
    "The shape and extent of this deviation are examined using a model of the photogoniometric measurement. This model is evaluated for different examples of sources and translations to understand the dependencies of this effect.\n",
    "The model and findings are then validated using far-field measurements of an object with a known center of light.\n",
    "- How can the uncertainty of the translation of the object be expressed?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the offset of the source would be known, it could be corrected before as well as after the measurement. The position of the object needs to be assigned with a sensible uncertainty, which expresses the confidence in the correct placement. The paper discusses ways of modelling this uncertainty by simple means. \n",
    "The aforementioned model of the goniometer is then used to propagate the uncertainty of the position to an uncertainty of the LID.\n",
    "+ model needs LID as input, not known for the object to be measured.\n",
    "+ Propose a tool to calculate the uncertainty of an LID measurement, that uses the measurement result as an estimation of the underlying LID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give answers and derive guidelines that are applicable to far field measurements.  \n"

    "Measuring light intensity always implicitly models the object as a point source. The light centre of a light source is the point, that suits this model best.

    "## Modeling the error from LC\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical Model of goniometer with translated point source.  The LID is generally calculated from the illuminance distribution in a certain distance from the photometric Center: A point light source with the distribution$I_s(\\theta,\\phi)$ placed in the center has a illuminance distribution according to the inverse-square-law:\n",
    "$$E(\\theta,\\phi) = {I_s(\\theta,\\phi) \\over {r_c}^2} \\cdot cos(\\alpha_d)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With $r_c$ being the measuring distance to the center and $\\alpha_d$ being the incidence angle of the light striking the detector. Both the source and the detector are modelled as points. This implies, that the distance between the source and detector is assumed to be sufficiently large so that the error from both point-assumptions is negligible. Since the distance between source and detector is known and the detector is oriented perpendicular to the source, the luminous intensity distribution can be calculated:\n",
    "$$I_m(\\theta,\\phi) = {E(\\theta,\\phi) \\cdot r_c^2} = I_s$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the measurement $I_m$ is consistent with the true LID $I_s$. If we now introduce a translation to the LC, the measured LI deviates from the LI of the source.\n",
    "- introduce coord system here, picture with all angles etc.\n",
    "- notation: every angles measured are marked according to the origin to which they are measured. $\\theta_c$ and $\\phi_c$ describe a direction originating from the photometric center and therefore correspond with the angles of the C-plane coordinate system. Similarly $\\theta_s$ and $\\phi_s$ describe angles relating to the light source.\n",
    "- Aim: calculate the error between the measured luminous intensity $I_m(\\theta_c, \\phi_c)$  and the corresponding luminous intensity of the source $I_s(\\theta_c, \\phi_c)$ resulting from a certain translation. The relation between $I_s$ and $I_m$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I_m(\\theta_c,\\phi_c,\\mathbf{s}) = \\underbrace{I_s(\\theta_s,\\phi_s)}_\\text{direction} \\cdot \\underbrace{r_c^2 \\over r_s^2}_\\text{distance} \\cdot \\underbrace{cos(\\alpha_d)}_\\text{incidence}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The influence of LC translation can be separated in three different components. With the goniometer moved to a certain direction measured with $\\theta_c,\\phi_c$ the LID of the object is actually sampled at diverging angles: $\\theta_s, \\phi_s$. This component is called the **Direction Error**. Additionally the distance between source and detector is now different for every direction introducing a **Distance Error**. Lastly the incidence angle of the light striking the detector changes, resulting in the **Angle of Incidence Error**.\n",
    "These three components will now be derived and explained in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Distance Error**\n",
    "Because luminous intensity is not measured directly but instead inferred from illuminance, it requires the knowledge of the distance between source and detector. With the source offset from the photometric center, this distance $r_s$ is different for every detector position. But when converting to luminous intensity the constant distance to the photometric center $r_c$ is used isntead, introducing an error. To describe this error both source and detector are expressed as points in the coordinate system of the goniometer.\n",
    "Position of the source: $\\mathbf{s} = (s_x,s_y,s_z)$\n",
    "Position of the detector for a particular measurement direction: $\\mathbf{d(\\theta_c,\\phi_c)} = (d_x,d_y,d_z)$\n",
    "The cartesian coordinates of the detector position are converted from the given C-plane (or polar)-coordinates as follows:\n",
    "$$d_x(\\theta_c,\\phi_c) = r_c \\cdot sin(\\theta_c) \\cdot cos(\\phi_c)$$\n",
    "$$d_y(\\theta_c,\\phi_c) = r_c \\cdot sin(\\theta_c) \\cdot sin(\\phi_c)$$\n",
    "$$d_z(\\theta_c,\\phi_c) = r_c \\cdot cos(\\theta_c)$$\n",
    "The distance between source and detector is then $r_s = \\vert\\vert \\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{sd}} \\vert\\vert = \\sqrt{\\dots}$ Applying the inverse-square-law as before yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I_1 = {{I_s \\over {r_s}^2} \\cdot r_c^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Direction Error**\n",
    "The angles $\\theta_s, \\phi_s$ describe the direction at which the detector is pointed at the source. To calculate these angles the detector positions realtive to the source position are required. These are the vectors $\\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{sd}}$ treated as points $\\mathbf{sd} = (sd_x, sd_y, sd_z)$. This basically corresponds to a coordinate transform from the photometric center to the position of the source. These cartesian coordinates are then converted back into C-plane (or polar)-coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_s(\\theta_c,\\phi_c,\\mathbf{s}) = cos^{-1}({sd_z \\over r_s})$$\n",
    "$$\\phi_s(\\theta_c,\\phi_c,\\mathbf{s}) = tan^{-1}({sd_y \\over sd_x})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the other two error components the direction error is not just defined by the geometry of the measurement but instead introduces a dependency on the LID of the source that is measured. In the simplest case, where the LID is isotropic, this error is nonexistent since the luminous intensity $I_s(\\theta_s,\\phi_s)$ is the same as $I_s(\\theta_c,\\phi_c)$. The extent of this error is defined by the difference in luminous intensity between the assumed and actual measurement direction. It therefore scales with the gradient of the LID of the object and will be larger for directions with a high gradient in luminous Intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Angle of Incidence Error**\n",
    "Lastly there is an error because a translation of the source changes the incidence angle. It is the angle $\\alpha_d$  between the vectors $\\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{cd}}$ from the photometric center to the detector and $\\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{sd}}$. It's defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$cos(\\alpha)={\\langle \\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{cd}},\\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{sd}} \\rangle \\over \\vert\\vert \\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{cd}} \\vert\\vert \\cdot \\vert\\vert \\mathbf{\\overrightarrow{sd}} \\vert\\vert}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " Since all parts of the error are invariant to scaling, this model can also be used with relative units. When applicable for the following investigations all distances are expressed relative to the measurement distance $r_c$. This allows for generalized insights, that are valid for all goniometer setups.\n"

    "## Evaluation of Influence of LC-Offset\n",
    "- With this model we can examine the influence of translated LC for different szenarios.\n",
    "- Translation has three components, one for every dimension.\n",
    "- Examine cos^n sources increasing n: more narrowly bundled LID\n",
    "    * good approximation for many sources\n",
    "    * (approximately) rotationally symmetric LID\n",
    "    * degrees of freedom of LC reduced: translation effectively has two components: along and orthogonal to the optical axis of the source\n",
    "    * Optical Axis is Z-Axis. Orthogonal to that is X-Y plane.  \n",
    "    * therefore: examine X-Y-Offset and Z-Offset separately\n",
    "### X-Y Offset\n",
    "- Normally an object with a roationally symetrical LID has the same symmetry in its cosntruction: e.g. a round opening / shape with a destinct center.\n",
    "- Object is oriented accordingly: attempt to align principal axis of goniometer with optical axis of source.\n",
    "- there are two reasons for X-Y Offset: \n",
    "    * Placement error, source not aligned\n",
    "    * deviations from rotational symmetry: in LID of light source and in optics\n",
    "- both of these influences are usually small.\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "Cos^1 Source, translated orthogonally by 1/1000.\n",
    "- This means: for a measurement distance of 1m it would be translated by 1mm\n",
    "- Cos^1: Lambertian characteristic.\n",
    "- Result is shown in the following illustrations:\n",

    "3D-depiction of the original LID as a grid and the deviation resulting from the offset LC. Left Side: offset in X / right side offset in Y. Results in the same deformation, just rotated. To make the influence visible, the deviation is exaggerated by a factor of 100. The deformed LID is shaded according to the error in each direction relative to the luminous intensity along the optical axis (Hauptabstrahlrichtung).\n",

    "The Z-position of the LC is generally hard to estimate. Even given a rotational symmetry there is no indicator where the LC should be assumed along the optical axis.\n",

    "One assumption to make is that the LC is inside the housing. Does not have to be the case - e.g. highly focusing optics\n",
    "standard procedure is often to position the object with the (Austrittsfläche) at the origin\n",
